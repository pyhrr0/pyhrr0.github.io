SOLID is an acronym for five software design principles that aim to make code more
maintainable and flexible. These principles can be applied to any programming language
and can help developers write better code that is easier to understand, change, and
test.

The five SOLID principles are:

- **Single Responsibility Principle**:  
  A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that it should have a
  single, well-defined responsibility. This helps to reduce the number of changes that
  need to be made to the code when requirements
  change.

- **Open/Closed Principle**:  
  Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification, meaning that they
  should be designed in such a way that new functionality can be added without modifying
  the existing code.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle**:  
  Subtypes should be able to replace their base types without affecting the correctness
  of the program. This means that objects of a derived class should be able to replace
  objects of the base class without causing any problems.

- **Interface Segregation Principle**:  
  A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. This means that
  classes should only be required to implement the methods that are relevant to their
  specific functionality.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle**:  
  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather both should
  depend on abstractions. This means that the code should be written in such a way that
  the high-level parts of the program do not rely on the specific details of the
  low-level parts, but instead rely on a more general interface.

By following these SOLID principles, developers can write code that is more
maintainable, flexible and easy to understand, which makes it easier to update and
expand the code as the requirements change over time.
